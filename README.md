This script will imprint a periodic structure onto the motion of the Z axis to compensate for incosistent (periodic) Z motion.
It will NOT do anything for Z wobble, only Z banding caused by z-axis movement error.

For clarity, wobble is a periodic shift in layers due to lateral movement of the stage wheras the banding referred to here
is a periodic dilation in layers.
