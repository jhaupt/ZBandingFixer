This script will imprint a periodic structure onto the motion of the Z axis of a 3D printer to compensate for incosistent (periodic) Z motion.

It will ingest the newest .gcode file in the same directory as itself, modify all the Z movements according to variables defined in the script, and write it back to the same file.

The shape of the periodic structure is defined by an easy-to-read Fourier Series. Delete all but the first term to get a sine wave.

It will NOT do anything for Z wobble, only Z banding caused by z-axis movement error.For clarity, wobble is a periodic shift in layers due to lateral movement of the stage, wheras the banding referred to here is a periodic dilation in layers.

Use with extreme care. This code has only been tested with gcode generated by Simplify3D.
